1,abortion,Con,c-kill,Q34,I believe that abortion cannot be justified because it is killing an innocent human being.
2,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,Q34,"Moreover, United Nations declaration says children have a right to protected before as well as after birth!"
3,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,M25,"Even if it doesn't have a brain, my belief is that the PERSON still has a soul. The soul is what gives the PERSON LIFE"
4,abortion,Con,c-sex,O43,"Can't you use a condom while having sex. Yes, having the baby puts the teen mother in a bad spot, but it's her fault for getting pregnant in the first place."
5,abortion,Con,c-kill,Q35,to abort a child is killing the child.
6,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,Q35,"From the time of conception, a child is alive"
7,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,M24,"If its taking nourishment from its mother, it's not quite a human being yet."
8,abortion,Pro,p-right,J17,"I simply think it's the lesser evil of two, especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions, they just stop safe abortions. This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother."
9,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,J16,This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves…is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE
10,abortion,Con,c-kill,G2, We should not abort a fetus simply for the purpose that it will cause or bring convenience to us.
11,abortion,Con,c-sex,B48,"every action has a consequence, and to say that just because you don't want to face that consequence does not mean you don't have to."
12,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,A27,"First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother."
13,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,C40,Brain waves have been recorded by EEG (electro- encephalograph) in the human embryo 40 days after fertilisation
14,abortion,Pro,p-other,A26,"I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else."
15,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,T29,There are more unwanted children than families willing to adopt
16,abortion,Con,c-adopt,T28,"babies that are adopted are given to families who want to raise them, not to just put up with them for a few months so they wouldnt be ""shuffled around in foster care"" they would be in permanent homes"
17,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,Y23,isnt that a good thing that they dont feel anything?
18,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,Y22,"Its not a child , its a fetus. It has no feelings at all!"
19,abortion,Pro,p-right,U21,Personally i think that people should have the ability to make there own choice.
20,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,U21,"its better to abort an unwanted child than have it born into poverty and have it suffer immensely with hunger, etc. Also if an unwanted child is born because abortion wasnt an option. That child grows up without love, care, etc and again brings them into a cruel and punishing world with no love or support system also putting them at risk of depression later in life.  It may seem cruel or unfair to abort a child but honestly its far more cruel and unfair to bring a child into a world of poverty, hostility, hatred and other situations and emotions that often surround having an unwanted child."
21,abortion,Pro,p-right,U20,I am for a woman's right to chose.
22,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,U5,A fetus is also just cells. It is also not human yet.
23,abortion,Pro,p-other,R12,There is no point in bringing life into this world if there are no structures in place to support this life.
24,abortion,Con,c-kill,U4,YOU DON'T SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH KILLING AN INNOCENT LIFE?????
25,abortion,Con,c-kill,J29,Abortion is wrong because it takes a life.
26,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,J29,The child in the raped woman's body…how is he/she at fault. Why should they lose their life because an act of violence happened to another living human being.
27,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,G23,A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs.
28,abortion,Pro,p-right,G22,"The fetus uses the mother's body as its host. It depends solely on her for survival; no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation. If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so"
29,abortion,Con,c-kill,A19,And when done on humans it ends the life of a human in the early stages of development.
30,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,A18,"Technically speaking, a fetus is not a human yet."
31,abortion,Pro,p-birth_ctrl,A18,Having an abortion is similar to wearing a condom.
32,abortion,Con,c-bad_4_mom,R2,Won't killing the fetus have a potential emotional side-effect on the parent? They would go through life knowing that they killed their own child.
33,abortion,Pro,p-sick_mom,R3,sometimes a child being born causes great strain on the parents and could possibly lead to death.
34,abortion,Pro,p-right,R3,"Therefore, I believe that it should be the person's choice."
35,abortion,Con,c-adopt,O34,Just because the child is unwanted does not mean it is unloved furthermore there are far more suitable alternatives like adoption
36,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,S25,the fetus is a living being that is growing and was created by God what right do you have to destroy what he has made good.
37,abortion,Con,c-sex,S25,You just should not have had sex in the first place
38,abortion,Pro,p-right,O35,WOMEN CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY'D LIKE TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BODIES.
39,abortion,Pro,p-other,O35,The odds of a mother not being able to have children later are so low.
40,abortion,Con,c-kill,S24,it would be murder and disgrace to kill a child that has yet to be born
41,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,S24,it is not the unborn child's fault that they was to be given life. the ones who conceded the child are at fault.
42,abortion,Pro,p-right,T17,I    sure as hell don't have the right to commandeer someone else's body against their will for nine months to keep myself alive and neither does a fetus.
43,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,T17,Even if a zygote or early term fetus was a person (which it isn't)...  And even if that person had all the rights that other people have (which it doesn't).
44,abortion,Con,c-adopt,T16,There is always adoption as an option!
45,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,T16,A person shouldn't be allowed to kill a future child.
46,abortion,Con,c-sex,T16,They are willing enough to create the child and I believe that they need to own up to their own responsibilities. It was their choice to tango and they need to pay up for it.
47,abortion,Con,c-adopt,I6,There are other ways the child can get taken care of.
48,abortion,Con,c-kill,I7,Their parents kill them before they have a chance at life.
49,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,I7,they dont even have a chance to live before they die.
50,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,C36, A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana.
51,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,C37, Both are unfeeling. Both are unaware of existence. Both are composed of cells. Both have metabolism. Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds)
52,abortion,Con,c-kill,J2,  The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING.
53,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,J2,But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission? The unborn can't speak for themselves.   It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.
54,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,R19,"A one month old embryo is only alive in the strict biological sense, the same way a plant is alive."
55,abortion,Pro,p-right,J3," One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out."
56,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,J3," Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused."
57,abortion,Con,c-adopt,R18,Put the baby up for adoption.
58,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,R18,"A fetus is alive, regardless of how developed it is."
59,abortion,Con,c-adopt,S11,You can have them be adopted if you are not ready with the child.
60,abortion,Con,c-kill,S11,Abortion = murder.
61,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,S11,And if they are human they have all the right to live.
62,abortion,Pro,p-sick_mom,S10,"permission for an abortion could then be based on psychiatric considerations such as prepartum depression, especially if there is responsible psychiatric opinion that a continued pregnancy raises the strong probability of suicide in a clinically depressed patient."
63,abortion,Pro,p-right,S10,I believe that abortion should be legal because the fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights.
64,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,S10,"I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand--namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body."
65,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,Y29,its not a person until the baby comes out
66,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,Y29,it can kill you to give birth
67,abortion,Con,c-other,Y28,I believe greater education is the answer to prevent teen pregnancy and the fallacy that abortion is just another form of birth control.
68,abortion,Pro,p-other,Y28,But I absolutely do not believe the government should ban abortion. That is completely out of their jurisdiction and authority.
69,abortion,Con,c-kill,C1,what happened to you should not have killed the baby.
70,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,C1,honestly the baby did not do anything to you.
71,abortion,Pro,p-right,T22,people have the right to decide.
72,abortion,Pro,p-rape,T22,if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child?
73,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,T22,some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor. this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life.
74,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,K15," No brain = no life. We don't care about what might happen, we care about present reality."
75,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,K14,so what if it doesn't have a brain yet still is going to get one and still has a whole future in front of him/her.
76,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,Q6,your heart is a mass of tissue so why dont you suck that out and chuck it in the bin
77,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,R50,"Once a human  ""organism""  is made it is alive. Whither people like it or not it is fact that it is alive.  It moves, it eats, it grows, it thinks."
78,abortion,Con,c-kill,Q7,ABORTION = MINIATURE GENOCIDE.
79,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,R51,I think that most of us on the pro-choice side would agree that a woman's right to chose ends by the time a fetus reaches the stage where it eats or thinks.
80,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,N40,A fetus cannot reproduce at the moment of conception.
81,abortion,Pro,p-right,X4,"A women should be able to choose what happens with her body, especially concerning abortion and babies."
82,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,X4,"In reality, it's not that bad, but forcing a mother to give birth to an unwanted child is cruel, and with the human population this high, with plenty of orphans already, why make more?"
83,abortion,Pro,p-right,B43, never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.
84,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,B43," If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.   It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul."
85,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,G8,sometimes it is...there is a a type of pregnancy that kills the mother AND the fetus unless its aborted..
86,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,G8, sometimes it is...there is a a type of pregnancy that kills the mother AND the fetus unless its aborted
87,abortion,Con,c-kill,G17,Ending a life isn't cruel?
88,abortion,Con,c-kill,R27,"I agree that there are times when an abortion is necessary, but when one want's to kill over the fear of parenthood - that is when things are getting out of hand."

90,abortion,Pro,p-other,R26,Abortion is a serious matter and unfortunately there are cases in which an abortion is neccesary;
91,abortion,Con,c-kill,B34,Even today if a woman kills or tries to kill her unborn she can be tried.
92,abortion,Pro,p-right,Y17,Every mother should have the right to do what they want to do and what they think is best.
93,abortion,Con,c-other,Y16,It should not be used as a form of birth control.
94,abortion,Pro,p-rape,Y16,"BUT, then the issue of rape comes into play."
95,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,Y16,Along with the health of the mother at risk.
96,abortion,Con,c-sex,Y16,"If you don't want a child, don't have sex."
97,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,M5,"technically a fetus is indeed alive, a zygote is alive."
98,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,M4,"An unborn child has no reason; it has no choices to create over itself. No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions.  -It has no emotion, no joy, sadness or pity."
99,abortion,Pro,p-right,M11,Who are any of you to decide what is right for a pregnant woman?
100,abortion,Pro,p-rape,M11,When a woman has been raped and impregnated she doesn't deserve to have the choice?
101,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,M11,We would have children being born into homes where they are unwanted
102,abortion,Pro,p-right,M10,People should be allowed to do whatever they like with there own body.
103,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,M10,"Abortion to me is no different than jizzing in a rag, sure there is potential that those cells could have made a person, but they aren't now and that they never will shouldn't bother anyone in the least."
104,abortion,Con,c-kill,G29, Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women
105,abortion,Pro,p-right,G28,"What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex."

108,abortion,Pro,p-right,J23,"Well really, it's they're choice what they wanna do."
109,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,J22,"The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element."
110,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,J22,"I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not."
111,abortion,Con,c-kill,N15,"It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder."
112,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,N15,"It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body."
113,abortion,Pro,p-right,T2, don't understand why we feel that we get to dictate what other people can do with their bodies.
114,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,T2,im sorry but i would much rather have my baby in heaven then on earth if i couldn't take care of it.
115,abortion,Pro,p-right,N14,It is the woman's body.  It is none of your business what another does with their body.
116,abortion,Con,c-adopt,T3,giving up your child for adoption is an act of love rather than hate
117,abortion,Con,c-other,T3,Most adopted children do not become suicidal. they might wonder about their biological parents but i wouldnt say they think that they hated them.
118,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,B16,"Rape is more iffy of course, but I don't think the child should have revenge taken out on them for being raped. The father who raped the women should suffer: not the child"
119,abortion,Pro,p-other,B16,I can understand it if the baby has a deformity that WILL actually hurt them in the future
120,abortion,Con,c-adopt,O7,I believe adoption is a good option.
121,abortion,Con,c-kill,O7,"However, it is immoral to abort always."
122,abortion,Con,c-sex,O7,Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg.
123,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,M33,there are women who consider that thing growing in them for the first 3 months nothing more than a cluster of cells?

127,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,Y8,For instance what if it wasnt a accident to have the child and the mother found out that her soon to be baby was special ed.
128,abortion,Con,c-kill,F5, I want to add that many childern have been killed because of abortion
129,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,F5,"What if you had gave them a chance to live, because they have this right to live"
130,abortion,Con,c-bad_4_mom,H1,it harms to the health of woman. Even in future this woman cannot have any babies.
131,abortion,Con,c-kill,H1, it is inmoral according to philosophy.
132,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,C21,It has no mind. It has no awareness.
133,abortion,Con,c-adopt,C20, just give the child to someone else.
134,abortion,Con,c-kill,C20,You are killing a living breathing human being
135,abortion,Con,c-bad_4_mom,O23,"When a woman has an abortion, she will always think about the baby she might have had. She will always think about the future that could have happened with her baby which will always remind her that she killed it.

141,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,O22,"It is wrong to bring unwanted children into the world, because in the future this child will live and doesn't know what mother's love is."
142,abortion,Con,c-adopt,A3,"Please consider adoption. Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile. Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't."
143,abortion,Con,c-kill,A3, that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.
144,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,A3,Now to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?  At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dog
145,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,B28,The cell results from fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm and is the beginning of a human being.
146,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,A2,I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks
147,abortion,Pro,p-rape,A2,"  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby?"
148,abortion,Pro,p-birth_ctrl,A2," If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one"
149,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,A2," think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number,"
150,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,P15,An unborn fetus is not a human.
151,abortion,Pro,p-baby_ill_treatment,S5,"but there is also the fact that why should a baby that nobody wanted be born, when the parents dont want them to be around?"
152,abortion,Pro,p-right,S4,its also the mother's choice
153,abortion,Pro,p-rape,S4,what about those who are raped and unfortunate with a baby of that specific person.
154,abortion,Pro,p-birth_ctrl,S4,"all an abortion is, is preventing a baby from being born into the world. if thats the case, then what are we doing by using birth control or condoms. we are preventing a baby from being born into the world."
155,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,T49,"It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born."
156,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,T48,"I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being."
157,abortion,Con,c-sex,Y3, if you don't want to get pregnant why are you having sexual activity
158,abortion,Con,c-adopt,Q29,if you say for instance get raped or the condom breaks give the baby up for adoption
159,abortion,Con,c-kill,Q29,you are taking a life away even if the baby is not alive
160,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,M38,"Many a times, abortion helps to safeguard women's health. There are many women, who suffer from various hazardous medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, severe diabetes, etc. As these diseases can be life-threatening, an abortion often helps to avoid serious medical complications from childbirth."
161,abortion,Con,c-kill,Q28,I am against abortion because it is practically kill the baby inside the womb. And that is a innocent child in the womb if you decide to abort the child you are basically committing murder and destroying a innocent life.
162,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,M39,"As it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord, its health is dependent on her health, and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb."
163,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,P21,early abortions you are removing a small fetus that lacks a brain but has a underdeveloped nervous systems which is why they move when abortion apparatus is inserted.
164,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,P21,"Saying that, late term abortions are appalling a fully developed baby is being murdered, developed brain, developed nervous system and developed lil hands."
165,abortion,Pro,p-right,P1,"Making abortions illegal has been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths."
166,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,P1,In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.
167,abortion,Pro,p-other,P1,"If one side is not forcing one to abort, what gives another a right to force another not to abort?"
168,abortion,Pro,p-rape,P20,It's simply being humane to rape-victims
169,abortion,Con,c-kill,O17,No abortion is wrong.
170,abortion,Con,c-kill,B7,"And that is what abortion is...whether its in the first month...or ninth, its killing."
171,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,B7,"that which is in the womb is human, is alive and is a growing person."
172,abortion,Con,c-sex,B7,It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her.
173,abortion,Pro,p-right,B6,A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes
174,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,T43,"It doesn't matter if it will someday have emotions, presently it doesn't and is therefore judged as being less than human at this point."
175,abortion,Con,c-bad_4_mom,E1,"Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with, in some cases, the father of the child."
176,abortion,Con,c-other,E1,"Other birth control is readily available; thus, abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control."
177,abortion,Con,c-kill,E1,Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life.
178,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,E1,The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out.
179,abortion,Con,c-kill,B23,it's suddenly perfectly okay to kill an unborn child
180,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,B23,Since when is it acceptable for people say that because it's not 'quite human' we can just do whatever the heck we want with it?  The logic of something needing to PROVE that it has a right to live is just sick.
181,abortion,Con,c-kill,B22,Abortion in general is wrong in the sense of life being erased.
182,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,A8,"Before it reaches a certain stage in development, it'd still only be a potential and it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever."
183,abortion,Pro,p-right,O29,"If someone is using your body as a life support machine, don't you think you should have the right to decide if they continue to do so?"
184,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,O28,"If every human being( irregardless of if they are human ""persons"") has the right to life and to what happens to their body, then a fetus, by being a human being, also has those rights."
185,abortion,Pro,p-rape,E11,I think if you get raped and you get pregnant.
186,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,I13,I personally don't consider the fetus to be living

400,abortion,Pro,p-right,B4,I don't think any situation should dictate whether a Mother decides to proceed with a pregnancy. It's how the mother (or doctor)  perceives  the circumstance of her pregnancy. If she feels the unborn child would have a negative life or her life would be impacted seriously (not superficially) then she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.
401,abortion,Pro,p-birth_ctrl,B4,not all accidental pregnancies are because people are stupid enough to have sex without contraception

405,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,K7,An embryo and foetus are not lives. A life has a developed brain and body. The best argument you can make is that 10% of abortions might involve a foetus that is on the brink of being a life.

407,abortion,Pro,p-rape,E2,what about abortion for woman who get raped.
408,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,E2,the pregnancy is going to be difficult and therefore can lead to death of the baby and/or the mother.

439,abortion,Pro,p-right,P28,"The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body."

461,abortion,Pro,p-sick_mom,M47,Teenagers who become mothers have grim prospects for the future. They are much more likely to leave of school; receive inadequate prenatal care; rely on public assistance to raise a child; develop health problems; or end up divorced.

567,abortion,Pro,p-right,B30,human beings are given the right to kill others.

569,abortion,Con,c-adopt,B31,There is always adoption
570,abortion,Con,c-kill,B31,I think abortion is a a violent way to kill a living human being.

578,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,C39,"A nervous system is required to feel, but without a proper mind, one in development it isn't feeling anything we might consider human."
579,abortion,Con,c-adopt,J27,Support is an excuse…because there is adoption and there are services that help women who have no money.
580,abortion,Con,c-kill,J27,ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.
581,abortion,Con,c-other,J26,"You are ignoring the fact that most abortions are for convenience, not rape or any medical need."
582,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,A16,As a fetus the natural drive humans have for survival really isn't there. The mental capacity just wouldn't exist to care.
583,abortion,Pro,p-right,M1,"that still wouldn't be an arument for outlawing abortion since that requires declaring that the mother has no legal right to control over her own body. That it is superceded by another ""person's"" right to use her body for their own preservation."
584,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,M1,Since there is no coherent brain activity in early fetal development until AT LEAST 22 weeks we are most certainly not dealing with anything we could meaingfully call a person prior to that time.
585,abortion,Con,c-sex,A23,I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.
586,abortion,Con,c-kill,F11,"These little unborn infants are also living things as we are and when women kill them, it is the almost the same as killing an adult or a child."

592,abortion,Pro,p-right,N4,"Making abortions illegal  has  been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths."
593,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,N4,we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.

602,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,M21,It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb. So it is not human? How is it not living?
603,abortion,Con,c-adopt,O46,even if you don't want the baby just give it up for adoption.
604,abortion,Con,c-sex,O46,take responsibility for your actions.

608,abortion,Pro,p-right,R17,The mother has a choice because: 1) Pregnancy is a pain in the ass 2) Childbirth is dangerous and 3) If she goes through with the pregnancy she will have a human being she will be obligated to care for.

613,abortion,Con,c-adopt,Y26,BUT THERES ADOPTION
614,abortion,Con,c-sex,R6,i think that if you are adult enough to have sex you better be adult enough to take on the responsibilites that come along with having sex.
615,abortion,Con,c-adopt,R60,"If it pains the mother to keep the baby, then adoption is always an option."
616,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,R60,"Yes...it is unnecessary pain for the woman, but that baby didn't do anything wrong."
617,abortion,Pro,p-mother_danger,R60,My opinion is that the only acceptable case of abortion is when the mother's life is at risk.
618,abortion,Con,c-sex,R60,I think every woman has a choice--but that choice comes before the unprotected sex...not after.
619,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,G27,Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?
620,abortion,Pro,p-sick_mom,G26,"Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural."
621,abortion,Pro,p-right,G26,", I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims"
622,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,G26,A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.
623,abortion,Con,c-adopt,X11,"If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth."
624,abortion,Con,c-kill,X11,it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person.
625,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,X11,"From the moment of conception, a distinct human being, with its own unique genetic signature, has been given rise - thus from the moment of conception a human being starts to exist and as such, with conception the inalienable rights are also given to the human merely for existing as a human being."
626,abortion,Con,c-sex,X11,"The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus."
627,abortion,Pro,p-right,X10, If we take that girls right away to choose for herself girls will be choosing life because they were forced to not because they chose that it was the right thing to do.

634,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,I3,"Abortion violates the NAP in that it causes harm to another human, and so I cannot support it. As well, I cannot comprehend how anybody can think that their own choice trumps the right to the life of another; I am alive, if another life is alive because of me, but can be terminated by me at a moment's notice, in what universe is it acceptable for me to put my own personal desires ahead of that of the other life?"

640,abortion,Con,c-baby_right,Y18,What about the child who has no say?

644,abortion,Pro,p-birth_ctrl,O8,"Accidental pregnancies can happen to anybody, no matter how careful they are. To think a woman must carry out a pregnancy just because she dared to have sex is vindictive."

647,abortion,Pro,p-rape,R43,"Or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest, and she got pregnant."
648,abortion,Pro,p-right,P25,It definitely should be legal and be allowed for all women.  Everyone has the right on live.
649,abortion,Pro,p-not_human,P25,"up to embryonic day 14, embry has no central nervous system and, therefore, cannot be considered as a human being who has senses. Thus, it seems that an embryo is not human and abortion should not be considred as murder."

651,abortion,Pro,p-rape,P24,Especially if any women have gone through rape or any hard situation and it causes pregnancy then its the mothers choice.
652,abortion,Pro,p-right,P4,people should be free to get abortions if they want to

664,abortion,Con,c-adopt,B3,"putting it up for adoption,"

Conceiving while on birth control isn't always due to incorrect application or use of the birth control, sometimes a person just falls into that .01 percent where the birth control failed to do what it was meant to. In that sense, considering a person taking it who didn't intend on having a baby and the birth control failed, I would support her if she decided to have an abortion."

1725,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,C27,"To many, it seems hypocritical to keep marijuana illegal while tobacco and alcohol can be purchased legally."
1726,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,C27,People would be much less likely to ingest marijuana that is laced with something dangerous if the product was regulated to standards.
1727,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,C27,"We can spend less taxpayer money on the War On Drugs, and gain revenue from taxation."
1728,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,K78,Also a lot of comedians like to take their ideas from pot too haha
1729,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,K78,For one pot was never a direct cause of death to anyone unlike tobacco and beer.

1732,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,I57," Marijuana has no business being illegal when it is less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is not only legal but used by a large portion of the population. Alcohol poisoning kills people every year, as does drunk driving. Marijuana cannot be overdosed on, nor does it make people over-confident or belligerent."
1733,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K31,"And yes, many people want to get high on cannabis."
1734,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K31,"If you can prove that pot is dangerous to society, I'm all ears. No one has been able to do so."
1735,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K31, Both decriminalization and legalization both have many numbers that show it's beneficial effects on society
1736,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,I63, In 40 years of constant usage no user of just marijuana has ever gotten cancer or otherwise ill effects.
1737,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,I63, Did I mention you can build the body for a car using hemp polymer? Even space shuttles and planes! Then you can fuel them using hemp-fuel that has ZERO carbon emissions.

1741,marijuana,Con,c-Other,I62,"I don't think people should sacrifice who they are, in some cases their free will or their humanity.   When someone gives up their free will by becoming a slave to a hard drug or prescription mood and personality altering chemicals it is time for society to step in and give them back control.  Marijuana may be a petty offender, much less of an offender than alcohol, tobacco, meth, cocaine..etc.., but it is still a means of giving up who you are or keeping yourself in a state of non-growth.   We, as human beings, have a duty to ourselves to grow, change, improve, but always in the context of who we are. Drugs are a way to retard this development, deny who we are, and cope with a world that rejects us. It is an escape; an escape which noone deserves."
1742,marijuana,Con,c-health,I62,It isn't helpful; it's downright harmful in the long-run.
1743,marijuana,Con,c-mind,B53,"when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur"

1745,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K97,Nowdays this is true with pot and we are filiing up the jails with drugdealers petty pot charges and theres no room for the real criminals such as the rappist and murderers!
1746,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K97,in fact there are many more fatality or deaths using alchool every year.

1752,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K3,"There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad."
1753,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K3,"The war on marijuana, not all drugs, but marijuana, sucks up  so much  federal, state, and local money. Couldn't this money be better spent enforcing the other laws, say, the ones that keep people under the influence off the roads? Or maybe we could put this money towards something we can all enjoy, like lowering taxes."
1754,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,C12," cigarettes should definitely be completely illegal, but they're so ingrained into our culture that I highly doubt that is going to happen anytime soon"
1755,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,C13,Marijuana is  much  less harmful than alcohol and tobacco.
1756,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,C13,"Studies have shown that marijuana increases concentration and creativity, probably because it stimulates both sides of the brain."
1757,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,C13,"And I've never heard of using marijuana making anyone aggressive, so they couldn't use that as an excuse for demonizing it. :)"
1758,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,C13,"Not to mention, were marijuana legal, it's estimated that the U.S. would save around $11 billion a year (I'm not sure if the money we would save by not arresting otherwise harmless marijuana users factors into this, but it's still quite a bit of money)."
1759,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,E28,"If Marijuana is directly connected to harder drug use, then cigarettes lead to marijuana use and they should also be illegal."
1760,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,E28," if pot proceeds really went to terrorists, then we should legalize it, tax it, regulate it, gain the profits ourselves, and eliminate the terrorists' market."
1761,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K170, marijuana would most certainly become a muliti billion dollar industry if legalized.
1762,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K171," ""According to the data, the state's medical marijuana patients are currently consuming somewhere between $870 million and $2 billion worth of weed a year. That would translate to somewhere between $70 million and $120 million in state sales tax revenues, the authors estimated."""
1763,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,B1,"NUmber one standing fact is that alcohol alone has been charted to have claimed 100,00 lives a year and is still legalized"
1764,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,B1,sell the weed not the seeds u can still make profit
1765,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,B1,where are the statistics of marijuana related deaths
1766,marijuana,Con,c-mind,K195,The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen
1767,marijuana,Con,c-health,K195," I deliberately pointed out that it mentioned how carbon monoxide can harm the blood vessels, which is present in marijuana smoke as well."
1768,marijuana,Con,c-addiction,K195,cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven.
1769,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K194,Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal.
1770,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,K194, Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage.
1771,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,F30,Marijuana can open the mind making you more responsive to stimuli some people enjoy music more when they have had a smoke
1772,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,L5,Certainly seems like our country's been awfully fucked up since it was illegalized.
1773,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,L5,Weed used to be the US's largest crop.

1776,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K107,"Getting any substance off the street is dangerous. If it were legal, then safe marijuana could be easily attained. The laws keep marijuana use dangerous, marijuana use doesn't make marijuana use dangerous, however."
1777,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K106,"Oh well, the war on drugs is a stupid thing, its basically prohibition again, and that didn't turn out well."
1778,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K72,I'm tired of hearing about nice people who are doing 10 years to life just for weed.
1779,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,K72,Marijuana has so many benefits for sick people
1780,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K220,"Once they can be regulated by the FDA and sold in reputable stores, the amount of crime will go down and quality will go up."
1781,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,I15,"I mean, its not like its one of the ones that can kill you, any related deaths are from judgment impairment and thats no worse than alchohol."
1782,marijuana,Con,c-addiction,K73,its still dangroud and adictive like beer and cigrattes
1783,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K73,i think it would be a perfect thing for the Gov't if legel. Pot heads would still buy it for any price and it would help lower our debt.
1784,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K221,"Again, the drug use in Amsterdam is lower than it is here."
1785,marijuana,Pro,p-right,B25," If the purpose of a law is to give as much freedom to people without allowing those people to neglect or abuse others rights, then what right is being threatened by marijuana usage?"
1786,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,B25,Marijuana has less correlation to such things then the few currently legal drugs.
1787,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,B25,"Also as part of the condition for legalization the government can provide tax breaks and such for such companies, to decrease the only serious health risk and to improve the economy."
1788,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,E17, But the substance itself is less a threat than illegal guns.
1789,marijuana,Con,c-health,F12,The health effects are way too severe.
1790,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,N6,It seems to me that it would be much better if government direct all this money to improve education and medicine.
1791,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,N7,". Kazakhstan has a really big resource of marijuana in the South, in ""CHU"" and that place is really famous around the world."
1792,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,J10," its benefits on a friend of mine who has scoliosis. Muscle relaxants do very little for him and they have bad side effects, whereas pot helps him to function and leaves him relatively pain free."
1793,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,J10, that doesn't stop me from seeing that it has huge economic benefits
1794,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,J11,"even if they do smoke pot , it may be only occasionally and or they may detest the use of other drugs."
1795,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,J11,"my grandfather , when questioned as to why he had a 6ft mull plant in his yard , answered that he ate the seeds to relieve headache"

1797,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K51,"marijuana is actually less harmful than alcohol,"
1798,marijuana,Pro,p-right,I37,"the point is, not our fuckin' business on how someone decides to take the edge off."
1799,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,I37, making drugs an illegal business just gets more people killed anyway.
1800,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,I36,because it is a plant not a drug but if you set it on fire there are sidefects.
1801,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K50," it's no more harmful than alcohol or cigarettes,"
1802,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,K50,"with our current budget restrictions, we can't afford to save people from their own stupid decisions."
1803,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K202,Caffeine is also more addictive. I'm a slave to my morning caffeine fix - the day cant go on without it. Comparatively a much longer marijuana habit can be dropped and picked back up on a whim.
1804,marijuana,Con,c-Other,E35,Marijuana is a devil plant.
1805,marijuana,Pro,p-right,E34,The argument you are putting forth goes against the principle that the country's population can be trusted to make their own decisions as long as no-one else is harmed.
1806,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,E34,"Marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol."
1807,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,E34,"Furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth."
1808,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,E34,"Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit."
1809,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,I40,"Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind."
1810,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,I40,"about the medical uses, stress relief, etc,"
1811,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,I40,Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs?
1812,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,K26, ive grown up around people who have smoked pot or are smoking pot and it never made them hullucinate or slow down there motor functions in fact its actully help a few of them.
1813,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,K27,Medicinal marijuana is given to cancer patients who are DYING to ease the pain they are in.
1814,marijuana,Pro,p-right,L14,What happens in the US is that those who do smoke marijuana get caught with it and get put on probation.
1815,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,L14,"While they are on probation that start using Schedule 1 drugs like Cocaine, which exits your system in no more than 72hrs. This is why marijuana is a gateway drug."
1816,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,L14,"By legalizing marijuana maybe some of our tax money used to keep those in prison for having marijuana could go towards something better, like education."
1817,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,L15,It has little to no long term negative effects (decreases in short term memory + attention span for people smoking once a day for like 30 years)
1818,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,L15, Weed helps you think in new ways. What's wrong with that?
1819,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,L15,"weed would be good for the economy - You tax it, people buy it, the government makes bank"
1820,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K188,Marijuana does not cause people to have giant drug and violence filled orgies in the street.
1821,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K188,First of all you have no evidence that there would be a significant increase in marijuana use immediately following legalization.
1822,marijuana,Con,c-illegal,K189,I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions
1823,marijuana,Con,c-crime,K189,"Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America. Productivity would go down :) and some people would simply do reckless things."
1824,marijuana,Con,c-addiction,K189,don't say it's not addicting. I  know  people that are addicted
1825,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,I1,"The government could earn billions in taxes, shut down a black market, regulate quality"
1826,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K153,But I'm not gonna tell anyone they can't smoke pot or do meth because I don't like it.
1827,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K153,"And also, maybe if we legalized weed which has less health problems as opposed to cigs and alcohol, we wouldn't have to legalize meth, because it has shown it's devastating to your health."
1828,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,B38," legalize it, regulate it and tax the heck out of it. If the tax on cigarettes can be $5.00/pack imagine what we could tax pot for!"
1829,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,C7,you also have to consider that continuous usage of LSD can cause severe mental illnesses in people. There hasn't ever been a case of this happening from using marijuana.
1830,marijuana,Con,c-Other,K167,I highly doubt marijuana would spark a billion dollar industry. There would still be a lot of private growers to circumvent the taxes on it and to make it cheaper.
1831,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K166, the economy would get billions of dollars in a new industry if it were legalized making way more jobs than the war on drugs has ever made and no longer would this revenue go directly into the black market.
1832,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,J4,it'd be taxable .
1833,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,K209,the war on drugs doesn't have to include marijuana.
1834,marijuana,Con,c-health,B44,"imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right."
1835,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K80,"First, it is morally wrong because the government restricts the free choice of individuals to participate in such substances"
1836,marijuana,Con,c-illegal,K80,The only negative aspect is that it may lead to a increase in drug addicts.
1837,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,K80,the number of people people killed every year with selling or buying drugs is simply unnecessary and unjust
1838,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K80,"Second, economically, instead of enforcing drug prohibition with $10 billion of spending, the government could control the supply of drugs by legally selling the product and taxing where estimates range in $10 billion dollars as well."
1839,marijuana,Con,c-illegal,G10,I don't think that driving high and drunk are the same. But they are both bad. And will happen more if weed id legalized.
1840,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K81,weeed for life man without potsmokers there wolud be no gang violance it unbalnces the life cycle
1841,marijuana,Con,c-addiction,K12," If pot wasn't addictive, as most people claim, they can just stop doing it right?"
1842,marijuana,Con,c-mind,L21, Pot laced with what have you will send you reeling and there is plenty of stuff out there to lace it with.
1843,marijuana,Con,c-illegal,L21," For the safety of all, I would say no, don't legalize it with the exception of those who are terminally ill and have been prescribed it to calm them and take away some of the pain."
1844,marijuana,Con,c-addiction,L21, I came to the conclusion that weed should not be legalized because of the abuse factor
1845,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,K159,"Lol dude one of my good friends smokes pot everyday and has been for a year, he is currently the valedictorian of our high school... He also goes to work everyday while high as does exactly the same as everyone else!?!"
1846,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K158,"If someone wants to do it, they're going to do it whether or not it's legal (proof is everyone smoking pot today)."
1847,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K158,"I don't think that many people (including the person or people that will, 'cure cancer') want to waste their time smoking it."
1848,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,B33,marijuana does not produce withdraw when it's use is ceased.
1849,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,B33,"If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal."
1850,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,K65,alot more people would not die for two reasons the war and a drug deal gone bad my friend was shot and almost l killed in a drug deal gone bad
1851,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K65,the war is just retarded .
1852,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,K64,"I generally support the legalization of marijuana, which is really just another plant so whats the big deal."
1853,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K64,"taxation is good to convince govt to legalize it, although its actually onerous to add more taxes, so if it is done, it should be done as little as possible."
1854,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,D1,"And with said, marijuana is also not addictive, unlike other drugs."
1855,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,D1,"Marijuana is mentally addicted, yes... but so is  ice cream ."
1856,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,M2,Legalizing it would help are economy in many ways like jobs and much more
1857,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,M3,"Marijuana has been rated the least harmful drug in a study made in UK, which means that there is no less harm being done to people using the drug."
1858,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,M3," marijuana has evidence of pharmaceutical uses, such as treatment of glaucoma."
1859,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,M3," Because marijuana can be addictive, the government could sell the drug with a high tax, which would shrink the number of users of marijuana, and at the same time, stimulate the economy with these high payments going to the government."
1860,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,F26,why should it be illegal for someone who wants to get to get stoned on Marijuana to unwind but OK for them to get drunk which has a lot more health issues connected
1861,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K183,"because something is bad in the short term, doesn't mean it can't have long term beneficial side affects."
1862,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,F27,There was  NO  addiction at all in my case.
1863,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K93,"they need more money in the economy.. they would make a shit load if stores started selling weed and we would be out of recession, only everyone would be a pot head."
1864,marijuana,Pro,p-right,B57,Illegal marijuana is as inefficient as Prohibition.
1865,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,B57,"The difference is that the punishment is worse, and the drug is far less dangerous."
1866,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,B57,"Another example: Some people under the influence of marijuana have increased motor control, increased focus, increased efficiency in memory, etc; and some people experience these things WITHOUT experiencing anything bad either."
1867,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,B57,"Instead of jailing people, it should be legal, and taxed, and controlled by the government so that it doesn't somehow contribute to killing people."
1868,marijuana,Con,c-mind,B56,"What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. ""Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness."" So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, ""depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy"
1869,marijuana,Con,c-health,B56,"In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat."
1870,marijuana,Con,c-health,B4,"Whether it kills people or not, it still is harmful to your body. Ingesting smoke is not good for you."
1871,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,B5,"There are many things that are harmful to the body. Smoking cigarettes is harmful to the body and is still legal. As you stated above alcohol is more harmful than smoking marijuana, but it is still legal."
1872,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K49,And ending the ban would mean ending cruel mandatory sentencing that ruins so many young peoples lives.
1873,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K49,"it don't harm no one but the smoker, and that is really debatable too"
1874,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,K49,It even has medicinal benefit.
1875,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,C16,"At least pot is a natural plant and not a man made substance. Plus, since it is from nature, doesn't that say everything?"
1876,marijuana,Pro,p-no_damage,C16,When do you ever here of fatalities on the road because of someone being high on pot?
1877,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,C17,"Also, police would work with real criminal cases, not with drug deals."
1878,marijuana,Con,c-mind,F42,"All that Marijuana is doing is making people less intelligent, less concerned about life, less concerned about school, etc."
1879,marijuana,Con,c-illegal,F42,It is just going to bring a revolution of persons who do not give a bit of care for succeeding in life.
1880,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K103,There will always be drugs and there will always be terrorists.
1881,marijuana,Pro,p-right,K102,"If I want to use pot, that is my business!"
1882,marijuana,Con,c-illegal,I59,marijuana shouldnt be legalised becasuse then people will just get more and more of it because people will be abusing it
1883,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,I58,All the government would have to do is tax it and legalize it economy will shoot up!!!!!
1884,marijuana,Pro,p-not_addictive,K190,Once again as you failed to acknowledge marijuana does not cause reckless and uncontrollable actions like alcohol does.
1885,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,K190,"""I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions""   Once again you have nothing but speculation to back that up. This didn't happen with prohibition of alcohol and it didn't happen when Amsterdam legalized marijuana and it didn't happen when Portugal decriminalized all drugs."
1886,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,E12,"Instead of wasting money monitoring and prosecuting offenders, let's turn that frown upside down!"
1887,marijuana,Pro,p-right,E13,People can do what they like if the negative effects are cast upon themselves and not others
1888,marijuana,Pro,p-medicine,I83,watabout us tht useit for medical purposes?....Cancer or enfisema or eating disorders or cant sleep

Our big time criminals, the Mafia's, none of this small time dealers we've got going on with pot (and when I say small time, I'm more referring to the type of criminal activity that goes on with in these drug organizations), my personal opinion would be the only way to completely end the war on drugs would be to legalize everything."

2151,marijuana,Con,c-mind,E15,marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high.
2152,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,E15,"de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a ""druggy"" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse."
2153,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,E15, I think the children would benefit too. If it became socially acceptable to smoke pot in special cafes open only to adults then children would not have easy access as they do now with all the street dealers around.

2156,marijuana,Pro,p-Other,B27,The problem is that people under the influence of marijuana are more likely to commit crimes.   There is not a single shred of scientific evidence to support this notion.
2157,marijuana,Con,c-crime,B26,"The problem is that people under the influence of marijuana are more likely to commit crimes. If it is legalized, we need to be prepared to dump unlimited capital case appeals and do some executing."
2158,marijuana,Pro,p-legal,B26,"If we legalized marijuana, it would likely bankrupt the cartels, which are profitable because they are the biggest ""under the table"" distributer. People would have no reason to buy from them when they could grow their own, or buy it cheaply from WalMart."

None of the reasons are any more than those of cigarettes or alcohol."

2220,obama,Pro,p-economy,K56,"President Obama's 2010 Budget Deficit was $1.3 trillion.  For every dollar the government spends, that is one less dollar in the private economy, which the economy shrinks, which means less wealth is created.   We just entered and exited a great worldwide recession over a period of three years, in which Obama spent almost a trillion in economic stimulus."
2221,obama,Pro,p-republicans,K56,"I do not believe a Republican President would have done much different, because only Libertarians support doing nothing as massive businesses go bankrupt and take their employees and investors with them."
2222,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,K56,His diplomacy might be a step in the right direction
2223,obama,Con,c-War,E104,he is sending more troops to iraq and he said they would be out by 2012.

2225,obama,Pro,p-quality,J29,i think obama because obama been a good president so far all the good things he done for us
2226,obama,Con,c-health,A19,"Federal regulation of health care should be limited and focused  For example, individuals who are continuously covered for a specified period of time should not be denied access to insurance because of pre-existing conditions.  individuals should be allowed to purchase insurance across state lines, free from costly state benefit requirements.  Finally, individuals and small businesses should be allowed to form purchasing pools to lower insurance costs and improve choice.  Regulation can correct common failures in insurance markets, but it is often counterproductive.  Regulation places a burden on good portions of the economy, not just bad portions.  Regulations function as a hidden tax. The federal government’s own Small Business Administration placing the price tag of regulation at $1.75 trillion annually—much higher than the entire burden of individual and corporate income taxes combined."
2227,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,A18,"I would also like to point out that fetuses are not babies,"
2228,obama,Pro,p-health,A18,Health insurance companies have been raping us for years with double digit cost increases for absolutely no reason but that they wanted more money. For that alone Obama is already going to go down in history as a great president - hate to break it to you.
2229,obama,Pro,p-republicans,K21,"No one has a chance if elections were today. Even at his least popular he's been more popular than either politcal party, and more popular than any potential candidate."
2230,obama,Pro,p-job,K21,If unemployment is still above 9% in two years there may be someone who can beat him. That likely is not going to happen though.
2231,obama,Pro,p-economy,K20,"Obama as been helping to keep the economy from falling. Without him, our country's economy, government, and military would be in total chaos."

2233,obama,Con,c-economy,I7,"When people get taxed, all that money goes to the Federal Reserve, and since Obama's presidency, over a dozen trillion US dollars have magically disappeared from it. ($12,000,000,000,000) Where did it all go?"
2234,obama,Con,c-quality,K68,He should have never been elected to start with! He is anti-America!

2242,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,G84,"Unveiled a program on Earth Day 2009 to develop the renewable energy projects on the waters of our Outer Continental Shelf that produce electricity from wind, wave, and ocean currents.

2252,obama,Con,c-Other,E94,"Obama won because or country was so pissed off with Bush that a turtle could have successfully ran against him. People didn't vote  for  Obama, they voted  against  Bush, and unfortunately, our country was too angry and stupid to pay attention to the platform of our current Eunuch-in-Chief."
2253,obama,Pro,p-quality,K62,"every president with outstanding performance, pleasing personality, and with high-educated standard is qualified and deserving in its position like Obama."
2254,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,E95,"I, on the other hand, am not most people, and I supported him way back in the primaries based on policy.   I think he's doing great, overcoming a few rocky bumps at a time."
2255,obama,Pro,p-quality,N36,"He's more honest and his presidency has been markedly more transparent (it's one of his hallmarks; see: the White House webpage, e.g.) than his predecessors."
2256,obama,Con,c-economy,N37,obama got us 5.1 trillion dollars in dept already. Raised the tax on fuel and gave huge amounts of money to solar power manufactures. That are horrible at creating energy. And trying to make coal more expensive which are used in coal plants that make 50% of U.S power. Raising electricity prices.

2259,obama,Con,c-health,M4,"What has he done? Don't mention that health care reform because we both know that it is health insurance reform and health care reform is fixing the actual system who provide the actual care. Health insurance don't provide care, they finance it."

2261,obama,Con,c-job,F20,"Also, and this is not an attack on Obama's stimulus package ( I am here to learn), what jobs did Obama create that wouldn't have been created on their own."
2262,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,F20,Obama is clearly against a free market. In my opinion he has great ideas but they are too far fetched.
2263,obama,Pro,p-republicans,M82,I can agree with that Obama has done something and he is busier than Bush.

2269,obama,Pro,p-quality,K40,"Osama's death is some proof that Obama is a good leader. He did not reveal he knew where Osama was in his campaign, which would have guaranteed his victory. This makes him an ideal president."
2270,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,N15,"Net Zero Illegal Immigration from Mexico.   Inbound immigration was smaller this year than outbound immigration. Much of it is because of unemployment, but it is also because of enforcement by the Obama Administration."
2271,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,N14,"I remember hearing that he has already signed 2 republican-led bills to increase border security. After a third bill was pushed, he commented that no matter what he did republicans wouldn't be happy with border security until there was a moat with Alligators in it."
2272,obama,Pro,p-quality,J49,"He would be able to accomplish a lot more if the Republicans in Congress would cooperate. Right now they are purposely doing everything they can to hold him back, just so they can watch his approval rating go down. Fortunately he seems to be slowly moving forward despite their obstructionism."
2273,obama,Con,c-Other,J48,"I feel like Obama had so much hype that a lot of Americans are sort of disillusioned. Of course, many still think he's the Messiah, but more and more people who voted for him and supported him are realizing that he's not doing nearly as much as he said he would."
2274,obama,Con,c-republicans,B17, His policies on the War on Drugs are even more authoritarian than Bush's.
2275,obama,Con,c-War,B16,"he's failed in a lot of aspects that I thought he'd do better, drones in Pakistan and others, hasn't pushed Republicans far enough to help the economy, and hasn't done shit to stop everything with Iran."

2277,obama,Pro,p-War,G42,"Announced a plan to responsibly end the war in Iraq:   http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/ washington/28troops.html    (and has reduced troops to under 50,000 as of now)"

2282,obama,Con,c-quality,G122,Obama's inexperience is starting to show through. He has the entire house and Senate majority and still he has done nothing.
2283,obama,Pro,p-republicans,G99,Eliminated federal funding for abstinence-only education which was significantly increased during the Bush Administration to $176 million annually
2284,obama,Con,c-economy,M33,"the tax rate is going to go way up when out genarashon starts to pay taxs because of everything Obama has doen with our money. I personly think he could have thought of a better way to spend our money that is not waist full, or that the younger people will have to pay off. Obama should have not won."
2285,obama,Pro,p-republicans,F4,"I agree, bush put us in debt for the next 100 years, so we can blame him forever. You republicans are nothing more than a brotherhood of rich racists. You took us from our homeland and made billions of dollars off us and now you keep that money while we starve in the streets. You have kept us down so long we are killing each other because we have no money. It's time for you to give us your money and Obamas going to do it."

2293,obama,Pro,p-quality,M44,I just love the fact that there's somebody mixed race heading a racist country.  For that one reason I would vote for him.  If he does well for the country - good on him and maybe people will realise it.
2294,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B29,"You were only off by $5trillion.   for the wars (BOTH OF THEM)   $2 trillion+ is for the wars. That cost was inherited by Obama. Thankfully, Obama is ending this neocon trend."

2298,obama,Con,c-republicans,H11,"He's kept up Bush's policies, and only made them worse.   He's put this country into even more debt.  He's spent more than Bush's worse year.  I don't understand how anyone could say he's better than Bush."
2299,obama,Con,c-economy,J76," It's even worse and is still going downhill! 1 trillion dollars of debt not enough for you, eh?"
2300,obama,Pro,p-economy,H10,"We spent our way out of the great depression. Paying for tanks and planes. Paying for rifles, uniforms, and ammunition. Expenditure at this time was unprecedented. Someone had to make these materials. Factory workers suddenly had income again, and they could go out and spend their income. This spurred the economy."
2301,obama,Pro,p-republicans,K36,"Obama has been helping and taken control of a lot of important things that would have turned out badly. In his second term, if he gets it, he will be able to adress more and more problems."

2367,obama,Con,c-economy,K9,"First of all, he has had several years to fix the economy. No real greenhouse bills have been passed, they have accomplished nothing besides increasing spending. Saving the car companies did not prevent anything and he basically just plugged leaking holes in corporations that will never work due to the extreme wages payed to workers."
2368,obama,Con,c-War,K9,The war in Iraq is not over.
2369,obama,Con,c-Other,K9,Anyone could have appointed two Justices and he really didn't do a good job there creating the biggest controversy in the history of the Supreme Court.
2370,obama,Con,c-republicans,M35,I like McCain better than Obama. I think that Ron would be the beast out of them all though.
2371,obama,Pro,p-republicans,M34,"If Obama didn't win, think about McCain (shudders). Then even worse, if he died and Palin became president."
2372,obama,Pro,p-republicans,F3,"You've seen the job growth chart, read the healthcare bill and seen we're leaving both Iraq and Afghanistan I hope."
2373,obama,Con,c-economy,O1,President Obama doesn't have the first clue to economics nor do his economist advisers.
2374,obama,Pro,p-quality,A37," And actually Obama is near genius. He came from a lower middle class family, yet still received all types of honors all throughout school and in Ivy league schools no less."
2375,obama,Con,c-quality,A36, And I dont care that he's black he's also an idiot!
2376,obama,Con,c-economy,G125,"What has he done specifically for small business except wanting to tax more if you gross more than 250k, there has been not been any incentive for small business to expand? Go ask any small business owner and ask them first hand what Obama has done for small business. ""Nothing"""
2377,obama,Con,c-job,G125,If the numbers he gave was a mistake that wasn't very smart vetting process considering that almost everybody new before hand that unemployment was going over 8.5% it was just to sell his pork barrel stimulus which is not job creation once the money is all gone then those jobs are gone. Just like the cash for clunkers it was good when it lasted but automakers saw numbers jump 20% but now it's over there sales are back down 20%. It's not real job creation.
2378,obama,Pro,p-economy,G124,Obama has done plenty for  small business .
2379,obama,Pro,p-health,M42,"America has the best hospitals and doctors in the world, I'm just saying."

2381,obama,Con,c-quality,A5,Obama is another Hitler. There is not an ounce of capitalism or freedom in him.
2382,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,H16,It may be farfetched to say he's a socialist who wants to change the constitution.
2383,obama,Pro,p-republicans,H17,You're right it is far-fetched to say he's a socialist.  What change has he proposed to the Constitution? Don't you mean Republicans who have  proposed more than a dozen constitutional amendments ?
2384,obama,Con,c-economy,H7,Then why is it so hard for Godmaba to cut spending? Why does it seem like he thinks that MORE spending will help the economy?
2385,obama,Con,c-War,H7,"It's a catch 22 really. If we leave the country will descend back into chaos, and most likely back into the hands of a terror reigm. If we stay we continue to spend ourselves into debt as our service men continue to die.   Exactly! So why did he promise he'd get them out?"
2386,obama,Con,c-health,A40,I can only give him credibility when he can guarantee that has sat down and read all 1000+ pages of the health care legislation he is pushing so intently.
2387,obama,Con,c-quality,A40,"He is no more than a professional politician. He, just like any other politician, was elected by money and has not and will never know what the life of the average US citizen is like."
2388,obama,Pro,p-Other,A41,"Obama so far has been doing what he's supposed to be doing: talk about what his agenda is for the bill that is being debated and formed in the legislature, and correcting or clarifying misconceptions about what is being proposed by his administration."
2389,obama,Pro,p-economy,J39,"Yes, Obama will win in 2012 because by the then, the economy will bounce back to a decent level of satisfaction."
2390,obama,Pro,p-republicans,J39,"Besides, there is no real Republican who can challenge him right now with a so called celebrity status. Maybe this is why Palin is on the show face campaign before presidency campaign."
2391,obama,Pro,p-War,B67,he has managed also to do what bush never managed to do in taking down osama bin laden a man who killed over 3000 innocent Americans.
2392,obama,Pro,p-quality,B67,"calling him the worst president in American history is the most stupidest thing i have ever heard most of the people going against him are only going against him because he is black, no other reason."
2393,obama,Pro,p-Other,B67, your country has got better since he came in and he deserves some credit
2394,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B67,"Americans need to give him more time, he has had to sort out the massive mess bush left and also deal with mad people calling him the anti-Christ."
2395,obama,Pro,p-quality,B66,obama is a good president.
2396,obama,Pro,p-Other,E55,You are calling him a Socalist but he is not a Socalist.
2397,obama,Pro,p-quality,K31,"He is actually trying, the only flaw is that we the people tend to expect a lot out of our leaders, as many did when Obama was elected."
2398,obama,Pro,p-health,G94,"Signed the Children’s Health Insurance Reauthorization Act on February 4, 2009, which provides quality health care to 11 million kids – 4 million who were previously uninsured"
2399,obama,Pro,p-War,F9, On Foreign policy - are you arguing that he is pro war? Obama is trying to get us out of the wars we got into under bush II.
2400,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,F9,"On gay rights - maybe he doesnt fully support them, but he supports them way more than just about any other option. who is more in support of them than he?"
2401,obama,Pro,p-economy,F9,"How does Obama not know a thing about the economy? As far as i know he promotes progressive taxation, progressive taxation promotes aggregate demand which benefits everyone since this term is synonymous with economic health"
2402,obama,Con,c-economy,F46,anyone who says obama is helping the economy is dead wrong. Just look at all the debt he's accumulated with blatant disregard for the future.
2403,obama,Con,c-republicans,F46, He's accumulated about the same debt as bush in half the time.. so unsustainable deficits eventually leads to more quantitative easing and drastic devaluing the worth of the dollars you saved for retirement.
2404,obama,Con,c-economy,F47,it's pretty easy to understand the more money that eventually needs to be printed to handle this debt/unsustainable deficits of which is spiraling out of control currently will devalue the dollar that is already scarce to the 99% much further than we have already seen.
2405,obama,Con,c-health,N18,"People are also disapproving (for the most part) of the legislation he has introduced, particularly the health care act."
2406,obama,Con,c-quality,N18,Even many liberals are angry with him because of how many compromises he has made with the now republican house so he may not even make the nomination.
2407,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,K2,"I wouldnt necessarily say that Obama isnt exactly trying his hardest or not doing anything at all, I just personally dont believe that the direction that hes taking is a very good one or beneficial one. He has more or less driven himself into a hole of favor debt, one that he pays back in biased legislature, and hes part of the Democratic Political party which is essentially using him, regardless of what he thinks."
2408,obama,Pro,p-republicans,K3,"If anything is for sure, it is that Obama is giving it his all.  I feel that people are as a whole being harsh on a man that took the reins as the roller coaster only reached the peak."
2409,obama,Con,c-quality,C12,He really does not know what he is doing. That is obvious.
2410,obama,Con,c-Other,C13,"If anyone can give me a good example of JUST ONE thing Obama has done to help our country, I'll give that person a prize!"
2411,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,E29,I like his policies
2412,obama,Pro,p-quality,E29,I think he's pretty cool.
2413,obama,Pro,p-economy,M76,"Since the year Obama has been President the debt has increased by a percent similar too, and less than the debt increase during any given year of the Bush administration. In short, the Bush administration on average increased the debt more/ year."
2414,obama,Pro,p-republicans,M76,"I find that there is some deep dislike for Obama, yet when each reason for this dislike is analyzed in comparison to other Presidents it is easily seen that the reason mentioned, in your case spending, is not the reason at all."
2415,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,O10,He would have been able to fulfill his promises if he wasn't such a good guy who wanted to have bipartisan relations with the entirety of Congress

2426,obama,Con,c-economy,B1,He has not had a budget in 3.5 years
2427,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,F31,"Obama, who has an idiologically left (socialistic) alignment, is the best option. His efficacy at promoting socialist policies is limited by the right aligned political majority in congress, however, if he were able to promote his ideas our country would benefit over the long run more than it would otherwise."
2428,obama,Pro,p-republicans,F30,"Obama's doing well enough, I think, but any of the other Republicans would be very bad for the international community as a whole."
2429,obama,Con,c-foreign_policies,K106,His war with Libya is what has damaged his standing in Africa for good!
2430,obama,Pro,p-quality,J32,"Obama is a very smart black man who is also the most popular man in the planet!He's the first ever black American president and the people love him!He will be greater than Washington and Linkoln!Yes,he will win in 2012"
2431,obama,Pro,p-republicans,E7,He's doing a really good job especially considering what he was left with.
2432,obama,Con,c-health,E6, Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it   So if everyone else is doing it we should too? Most of these countries are having financial meltdowns because of massive deficit spending.
2433,obama,Con,c-economy,E6,"Your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact. Ironically, your point only proves why the Bush tax cuts should be extended: by lowering taxes for certain income brackets, the govt tax revenue actually goes up."
2434,obama,Con,c-economy,E85,"And, in fact, they are extending the TARP funds indefinitely with the new wall street bill. They advertise this as cracking down on Wall Street, but it really means that there will be a permanent bailout fund, something Wall Street loves."
2435,obama,Con,c-economy,L41,Obama has to destroyed the economy by printing trillions of dollars therefor lowering the value of the US dollar.

2448,obama,Con,c-job,G133,"Job Summit today. Basically Obama is saying he doesn't know how to fix it and create job growth.  I'll tell you how he could fix it is, is to get out of the private sectors way. Or resign your big spending agendas which is the disincentive why private sector is not hiring.   It cost a lot of money to run a business and make money in it, if he only understood that one simple principal."
2449,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,A20,Killing babies isn't wrong. It's called population control. Besides. We could use those fetuses for stem cell research.

2453,obama,Con,c-health,M23,"I don't think that the helthcare reform was good because we already have a bad economy, so this will make our younger genarashons have to pay it off."
2454,obama,Con,c-Other,G4,Obama he is so far of base that he is lacking the ability to communicate with his own party. Even with both the House and the Senate majority to his power still can't get any of his big agenda passed.

2457,obama,Pro,p-republicans,K51,"In my opinion I say we give him the next four, he is not nearly as bad as the eight years that preceded him."
2458,obama,Con,c-Other,K50,"He has tried to do what he said, but if you rate him based on a scorecard of how well he is implementing change, I would say he is failing."
2459,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,G53,Announced new policy steps towards Cuba
2460,obama,Con,c-economy,E35,I really could not vote for obama because once he signed his name for the bailout that was a red flag enough for me and it really should have been for all of America.
2461,obama,Con,c-quality,E35,But no they had to put the first negro they could find into office and look what we have know. A mess for many generation to pay the tab on.

2483,obama,Con,c-economy,F51,"If I got an dollar for every should Obama be reelected debate, I would have like $10.  If more debt and spending is something that you admire, then yes, but it will crash."

That is on top of more than 22 consecutive months of job growth.  3,000,000 jobs have been created in his presidency with improved economic outlooks."
2490,obama,Con,c-Other,J89,"Obama didn't do all the tasks that he promised to the people of USA. Therefore, Obama stinks, and yet again, Obama won't be the next president of the USA."
2491,obama,Con,c-foreign_policies,L20,I don't agree with his involvement in Libya at all.
2492,obama,Con,c-republicans,L20,I also hate the history of the underground democratic party. Not to say republicans are much better. The democrats always think they know what people need even more than the people.

2519,obama,Con,c-Other,A70,"What he failed to do however, was live up to those proposals. After claiming he was going to shut down Guantanamo Bay ( which contains potentially innocent people) years later, it is still open for business.

2529,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B69,It was said not just one president would be able to fix what bush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fucked up bush is the worst president ever that is why are economy is so messed up and most are not smart enough to relize that
2530,obama,Pro,p-health,E3,"3. It will actually bring everyone's cost down, including those who pay for it, including you if you pay for it. Under the current system we pay the most, including you, for the 33rd ranked healthcare in the world. It is a retarded system and had to be changed and Obama has been the only President strong enough to do such."
2531,obama,Con,c-health,E2,I'm sure the free-riders in this country will love it and those who realize that we have no way to pay for it will hate.

2537,obama,Con,c-health,E13, Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it    Don't make me laugh! Greece did the same healthcare plan and their poverty rate bounced up to 30%! When they were under 10% beforehand!
2538,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B20,"I have many complaints for the current government (Obama included, this started off as me defending his impact on debt), and over-regulation is one of them."
2539,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,B21," Bill Clinton had a different view on things. It was about having taxes that can match the spending. However, if spending is out of control, increasing taxes doesn't help. this is why Clinton cut spending so much that taxes could actually be cut instead of needing any raise, while still having an annual surplus."
2540,obama,Con,c-Other,K76,"what you need to realize is that this president is flawed by his actions, by his political stance, and his lack of control on our country."

2548,obama,Con,c-economy,B15,"As for stimulus, this does not help those who can't help themselves. this helps keep irresponsible corporations in power.  And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does)."

Everything's gonna be ok because Obama is in charge right? His allegiances aren't to the citizens of the U.S. and it's not to the constitution either (he's done a lot to change or ignore it). He works for corporate America: banking, wallstreet, and the new world order."

2575,obama,Pro,p-republicans,O21,Bush had to deal with the terrorist threat which was thrust upon him but i think that how he handled that was less optimal than how Obama has handled things since he took over.
2576,obama,Pro,p-quality,E18,he s very practical and efficient.he is able to even lead the world..america is still standing strait in the economic reccesion is only because fo him
2577,obama,Pro,p-quality,E19,Just another ploy by the desperate right wing to taint America's view of a wise and highly competent leader for their own political profit.
2578,obama,Pro,p-Other,E19,"The claim that he is turning this country into a socialist nation is ridiculous. We have seen what happens when there is barely any regulation at all, so obviously the government has to take some control."

2599,obama,Pro,p-economy,K16,"Besides, that, I mean, being the way I am, I would fight for the man who can get the job done without pushing too much to the economic extreme. Obama is the man I know I could trust on that issue."

2623,obama,Con,c-job,J21,Its not a matter of people finding jobs so much as it is companies hiring those people.   It is my opinion that the current administrations policies are not favorable for that happening.
2624,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,J21,I disagree with your assertion that the bail outs were the correct thing to do but that is another debate.

2640,obama,Pro,p-republicans,N3,For him to not be re-elected there would have to be a credible alternative. The Republican field is pretty weak this election since most top Republicans are going to wait until 2016 when the race will be up for grabs rather than try to take on an incumbent.

And I'm still trying to figure out why you are against something that will gaurantee  even your  coverage if say you're fired, that will force insurance to spend at least 85% of what you pay into it for healthcare (instead of new yachts etc) and will lower our national debt by half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years."
2665,obama,Con,c-economy,G141,A Fight I'm willing to have is Obama out of his mind. Does he really want to economy to get better? Why would he say something so asinine. Then if he is going to tear apart the banks then he needs to also tear apart the Unions for making GM fail and also for Fannie and Freddie which then he would have to go after his own lobbyist and tax them as well.
2666,obama,Con,c-economy,G140,Obama needs to shut his pie hole and stop talking about the economy on TV. He is killing any confidence out there when he is so targeted going after the banks and wall st.

2677,obama,Pro,p-economy,F52,"Our entire debt buildup of the past decade can be pegged to 5 things:  1) 2 unsustainable wars started by republicans  2) Three unsustainable tax cuts started by republicans  3) And unsustainable Medicare Part D program started by republicans  4) Unprecedented increase in military spending started by republicans  If you look at  Obama's new spending , you will see he has spent under $350 billion in non-recession spending."
2678,obama,Pro,p-quality,K83,"The proof is that the person who made the forgery admitted that it was a forgery, along with numerous factual errors on the forgery which confirm this. Such as an age error for his father. It states the city of birth as Mombasa, which was not part of Kenya at that time.  Have you seen Andrew Jackson's Birth Certificate? How do we be certain Andrew Jackson was born in the U.S.? What reason do you have to question Obama's citizenship besides the fact that you don't want him to be president?"
2679,obama,Con,c-quality,K82,I want to see the LONG version of his Hawaiian birth certificate as proof of that Kenyan forgery ;)
2680,obama,Con,c-Other,G12,How do you like the fact he has denied skimmers offered from other countries to help with the oil spill and he won't let them because of the Jones act?. quote Obama said to Florida Senator.  Florida senator: Obama told me we can’t deploy oil skimmers because they might be needed elsewhere.
2681,obama,Con,c-quality,B47,"When people are disputing whether obama is a good president or not, when they are for him, their biggest argument is talking about how ""bad"" of a president George W. Bush was. That is besides the point. It seems to me that people have forgotten about Reagan and Lincoln (just to name a couple)."
2682,obama,Con,c-foreign_policies,L23,im sure foreign policy (and atrocities) will only increase under the tenure of some gun toting republican.
2683,obama,Con,c-republicans,L23,"i hope Obama isnt re-elected, i hope some nutball right winger like Palin gets elected cause then the world will be forced to sit and take notice of americas hanus actions"
2684,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,G81,Empowered states to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards
2685,obama,Pro,p-quality,K11,"I believe what Obama He is young and ambitious, he is doing politics, he'd have kept the promise."
2686,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,G80,Issued an Presidential Memorandum to restore scientific integrity in government decision-making
2687,obama,Pro,p-War,K10,The war in Iraq is not over but atleast the president is making an effort to tend to it.
2688,obama,Pro,p-economy,K10,Saving the car company prevented many from being unemployed and also prevented a strain on the government providing unemployment benefits to recipients.
2689,obama,Con,c-economy,A29,The country is in ruins; Barack Obama is  not  working.   Get off your elitist high horse and face reality.
2690,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,G64,Played a lead role in G-20 Summit that produced a $1.1 trillion deal to combat the global financial crisis
2691,obama,Pro,p-Other,G65,"Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect"
2692,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B30,"The wars that Bush started cost about 3  trillion  dollars alone. This money was essentially wasted, in terms of the American economy. He also threw away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts (mainly for the rich), as well as deregulating the banks, causing them to rapidly spiral their risks, into what we now call 'a great big fucking recession'. Considering that he started off with a budget surplus, I hardly consider this a good record.  Then, you look at Obama. He's cut back on military spending, partially through removing troops from around the world (saving lives), as well as through straight cuts. In his first year, spending fell - overall spending growth in 4 years is lower than the inflation rate (0.4%). Obama is spending essentially the same amount as Bush did at the end of his presidency."
2693,obama,Pro,p-War,L54,Got Osama in 2.5 years after the last republican couldn't in nearly 7
2694,obama,Pro,p-economy,L54,"Jobs and GDP have increased consistently every month he's been president, while they both had decreased every single month just about for nearly 7 years before he was elected."
2695,obama,Pro,p-republicans,L54,"Besides, Republicans are too puritan and uneducated at their base to elect anyone who has even a passive chance of beating Obama this time around."
2696,obama,Pro,p-health,L54,Plus a president finally brave enough to fix our ridiculous health care system.
2697,obama,Con,c-health,L55,President Obama hasn't fix anything except make it more expensive.  Health care needs free market principles.
2698,obama,Con,c-economy,L55,"Really, is $14 billion in lost taxpayer money really saving the auto industry?  Loss   Is becoming $14 billion poorer a good thing? I don't so. Of course, these are based on government numbers, which of course, we can trust because the government has never ever lied."
2699,obama,Con,c-Other,L55,"Got Osama in 2.5 years after the last republican couldn't in nearly 7,   This is the case of Obama using political gain because Osama was likely already dead since he had liver cancer, which was reported on March 25, 2000."
2700,obama,Con,c-economy,K66,I could ramble on about wanting to change things in our country but the fact of the matter is that he has yet to change anything except raising our taxes more.
2701,obama,Con,c-Other,K67,I have no trust for Obama anymore! I can't trust somebody who believes its okay to build a mosqe at ground zero in New York!
2702,obama,Con,c-republicans,D3,Our country is in worse shape that when he was elected and the fact that he is backing down on virtually all of his promises and policies should tell you something isn't working.
2703,obama,Con,c-quality,D3,Obama is not a good president.
2704,obama,Pro,p-War,D2,All i got to say is that we finally got Osama when he was president... That says something.
2705,obama,Pro,p-Other,J27," Although on the basis of his current work, so long as the economy does rebound within the next year, and nothing else happens, he'd win a second term."
2706,obama,Pro,p-economy,J26, I voted yes on this question because I do think he will bring the economy around but I think it will take about three years which is right around election time.
2707,obama,Con,c-health,A17,The new health reform bill is not good. There are some good things but more worse than good
2708,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,A17,Obama is a pro-abortionist. Killing babies is wrong so stop doing it.
2709,obama,Pro,p-job,G104,Invested heavily in education both as a way to provide jobs now and lay the foundation for long-term prosperity
2710,obama,Pro,p-republicans,M1,"the odds of anyone chalenging him in 2012 who is of similar calibre are pretty close to non-existent. Especially from the GOP, where people operating at that level frankly simply do not exist right now and couldn't win a primary against the ""Tea Baggers"" even if they did."
2711,obama,Pro,p-republicans,F25,"To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well. I question the patriotism of the right wing because their policies tend to undermine total economic wellbeing which is fundamental to maximal economic prosperity"
2712,obama,Pro,p-economy,F24,For one he doesn't support regressive taxation or flat taxes.
2713,obama,Con,c-War,G131,"Obama more indecisive. He said that he had a plan for Afghanistan in June 2009 then in Sept 2009 he says that the next 12 months in Afghanistan are critical so he waits 3 more months to announce to the nation what his plan is going to be. So he just took 3 months out of him saying that Afghanistan the next 12 months is critical, what kind of leader is that?"
2714,obama,Con,c-job,G130,Yeah 10.2% today unemployment and still going higher when the next 6 months for him are going to be crucial.
2715,obama,Con,c-quality,J81,he said he will change the United States. But the United States is still going deeper in debt. We need someone who can stand up to Economic Crisis... Not someone who is just going to let our COUNTRY go deeper in debt.
2716,obama,Pro,p-economy,F11,"Progressive taxation is not theft, if you think of it in terms of % of GDP and also in terms of maximal aggregate demand, as well as understanding that wealth accumulation is made possible by the whole system operating collectively -&gt; the wealthy pay far less than they ought to, don’t contribute to economic prosperity as much as the middle class does, and all the while are able to enjoy a much higher standard and quality of living. Progressive taxation is necessary for justice and equity, not to mention that it reduces crime by ameliorating the stratification of wealth. Ameliorating the stratification of wealth reduces desperation and thus crime."
2717,obama,Con,c-economy,F10,"taxes must reflect government spending   No, the reverse is true. If the government decides stupidly to waste a billion dollars they should have that billion dollars in the first place, rather than to count on future taxation to provide them with the necessary funds. Ergo,  government spending must reflect taxes  (which ought never be high, or else they'll have a nearly infinite amount of money with which to traverse the world in search of demagogues to kill).   are you arguing that he is pro war"
2718,obama,Con,c-War,F10,"He's getting us involved unnecessarily in Libya, Uganda, South Sudan, etc., etc.   Obama is trying to get us out of the wars we got into under bush II.   All the while getting us into new ones.   as far as i know, these are the way they are because of Bush II.   Which is why I hate Bush, but they've been exacerbated by Obama."
2719,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,F10,he promotes progressive taxation   i.e. Theft.
2720,obama,Con,c-economy,L29,"Obama claimed that if he failed to turn the economy around by the end of his first term, he would not run again. The economy has continued to flounder, yet Obama now seeks reelection."
2721,obama,Con,c-quality,L29,"When a leader makes promises and fails to keep them, he should not be reelected."
2722,obama,Pro,p-economy,N5,"Haven't jobs and the economy only improved since his election? In case you're not sure, they answer is: yes."
2723,obama,Con,c-health,L28,we do not want his health care package
2724,obama,Con,c-republicans,L28,I don't think he should be re-elected because look at what he has done to this country. He has made it worse and if he does get re-elected he will make the country even worst than it all ready is.
2725,obama,Con,c-Other,L28,He campaigned on lies...He made promises he did not keep
2726,obama,Con,c-quality,L28,We have many capable blacks in our country who had experience who would have made a great president....Obama was not the right person for the job.

2728,obama,Con,c-Other,N4,"I certainly don't want another four years, I don't think the country could withstand it."
2729,obama,Con,c-economy,F83,The man spent more than all the other presidents combined in his first 2 years....
2730,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,K89,No absolutley no because he is communist marxist who has tried to destroy america from the inside on seperate occasions and if re elected be sure to live like slaves to a communist goverment
2731,obama,Pro,p-economy,F59,DOD budget is DOWN from last year.
2732,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,K52,"Sure, he should be granted credit for instituting progress towards socialism."
2733,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,K53,"What is wrong with a de-centralized planned economy? It is not taking away your democracy. Rather, it encourages more democracy.  In our current capitalist societies, 5% of the population controls 95% of the nations wealth. A nation that disproportionate sounds more like a caste system, not a democracy  A de-centralised planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of worker cooperatives; planning of production is done from the bottom up by local worker councils in a democratic manner  In other words, giving people MORE freedom."
2734,obama,Pro,p-republicans,K53,"""Ron Paul""... supports eliminating most federal government agencies, calling them unnecessary bureaucracies  If Obama is a socialist  Ron Paul is an anarchist"

2737,obama,Con,c-War,L17,He said war would end troops will come home. He lied. Now he is pledging that they come home a year from September
2738,obama,Con,c-quality,L17,He is a master manipulator.  He never delivered the positive change he promised. His change is NOT what the American people expected and wanted.
2739,obama,Con,c-job,L17,A jobless economic recovery.....unemployment numbers going up not down.
2740,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,L17,He has a socialist vision for America and has employed socialist czars to carry it out. Look at the list of self confessed socialist friends he has and has appointed.
2741,obama,Con,c-quality,L16,"Where is all this ""change"" He's promised our country. Yes it takes time but in his entire time in office our country has NOT changed for the good of anyone really."
2742,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,K25,"For standing up for gay rights and leading the fight against the discriminatory ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that prevents patriotic Americans from serving their country for something as silly as sexual preference, I will vote for him again."
2743,obama,Pro,p-economy,K25,"For passing a huge stimulus bill that fact checkers agree (check factcheck.org) helped us from going into a depression, as well as the bank bailout and auto industry bailout that, left unaddressed, could have cost the economy even more jobs, I will vote for him again."
2744,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,K25,"For negotiating the START treaty and seeing it passed in a bipartisan way, I will vote for him again."
2745,obama,Pro,p-health,K25,"For being a leader in the midst of criticism from both sides and having the audacity to believe that millions more Americans deserve health care as opposed to the Republican plan of not giving those millions of Americans health care, I will vote for him again."
2746,obama,Pro,p-quality,K24,"Hell yes he should, because he is the very model of a modern U.S. president and he can do whatever he like..."
2747,obama,Pro,p-War,G27,"So the solution to terrorism is to act like terrorists ourselves? We can to better. Torture is dishonorable and causes us to lose legitimacy. Besides, it doesn't work."
2748,obama,Pro,p-Other,G27,Kicking out lobbyists is  a fact .
2749,obama,Pro,p-republicans,G27,Bush did the bailouts wrong. He didn't include lending requirements for the banks. Obama did better.
2750,obama,Con,c-economy,G26,So you call the billions in Stimulus money that Obama gave to ACORN not lobbyists not to mention the hundreds of other small amounts given out to lobbyists.
2751,obama,Con,c-War,G26,We are nowhere close to getting out of Iraq like he promised. His original statement was 18 months. NOT. Any rational person including myself saw that not happening.
2752,obama,Pro,p-quality,B73,"Mostly, what I hear is that he's Muslim, Kenyan, or Black. Frankly, if he had blond hair and blue eyes, the outcome would look a lot different. When I'm surrounded by just white people and they feel a little more relaxed to use the N-word, that's mostly what I hear."
2753,obama,Con,c-quality,E100,Barrack Obama is not honest and unfit to lead

2756,obama,Pro,p-republicans,I2,"You have to support Obama by default. Yes it is very conceivable he is not the best suited president, but when you consider the other candidates it's disturbing he almost lost. While there is certainly no rule saying the more intelligent candidate is necessarily the better choice, in this case that should be the only thing considered."
2757,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,N38,gay marage should be leagle (that's not even a question homo's have the same right as the hetro's)
2758,obama,Pro,p-quality,N38,obama is one of the best president's we ever had.

2761,obama,Con,c-War,J65,He said hes not going to send any more troops to Iraq but i heard he did so he is a liar i don't like him.
2762,obama,Pro,p-republicans,L34,"Listen to popular people among them talk, like Sarah Palin or Newt Gingrich.  Given, Newt isn't stupid, though he's a little evil, almost like Dick Cheney. But, if you listen to many of them and are not dumbfounded by some of the blasphemous crap that comes out of their mouths, then I have no idea what false logic you follow, because there are indeed many, many,  too  many Republicans that are just saying things that you'd expect to be uttered by mentally traumatized and disabled people."
2763,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,O8, I think the most important thing he has done is make the US a bit more human on the international scale.

2777,obama,Pro,p-quality,F44," Agree or disagree with his actions, you have to give credit to the fact that he is a man who keeps his promises, and maintains integrity in both his personal and professional life That type of man is more likely to succeed for it takes integrity and committment to accomplsh worthy goals."
2778,obama,Pro,p-republicans,F44,"Obama took office, the deed was done, and he was faced with something akin to being given command of the 'Titantic'. Due to his diligence and vision, we are now beginning to 'see the light', in spite of the non-cooperative Congress he is working with."

2781,obama,Con,c-economy,B19,"Higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate.

They will simply pass the expenses unto the consumer, as we have seen with the healthcare and agricultural businesses."

2787,obama,Con,c-foreign_policies,O12,"How has he improved relations with other countries? Afghanistan still hates us (probably because we're invading them, but no one wants to talk about that war), Iraq hates us more than ever since we left, as soon as we got out of Iraq, Iran decides to start talking about a possible conflict with the U.S, and Israel is starting to hate us as a direct result from Obama's foreign policy on Israel."

2795,obama,Con,c-quality,L7,He was inexperienced.
2796,obama,Pro,p-Other,J30,Yes he will because he has helped alot and he hasn't been in office a full year yet. It's time for change and I think Obama is going to be the one who makes the change.
2797,obama,Pro,p-republicans,J30,People need to start supporting him more and understand that the world was messed up before he got in office. He has made a lot of things better so yes he will win in 2012.
2798,obama,Pro,p-republicans,J31,"Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh will not allow moderates like Giuliani or Huckabee, or even traditional Republicans like Gingrich to become the Republican nominee. Instead, far right ""heroes"" such as Palin will dominate the nomination process. These candidates will inevitably run poor campaigns that focus on false and trite attacks that the electorate is no longer as vulnerable to due to the widespread internet and decline of a single, easily influenced mass media. However, the Republicans will give a strong convention that will make people wonder if Obama is vulnerable, until a disastrous performance in the debates eliminates whatever hope they had. Thereafter, the Republican campaign will devolve into infighting and will run out of money due to the poor management skills of its leadership, which will cause all but approximately 40% of electorate, representing essentially tea-baggers, loyal republicans, and mistake voters, to turn against them. Obama will then win by a clear margin."
2799,obama,Con,c-quality,K105,"So far I see Obama is willing to make some sacrifices, but not the tough ones. Tough ones are required to climb out of the hole which we have dug. The borrowing has to stop. The printing has to stop. Or we will never get out."

2806,obama,Con,c-Other,J79,obama has done such a horrible job as president so far and more and more people are staring to realize it every day so i dont even think he should be nominated for the democratic party for the 2012 election.

2808,obama,Pro,p-War,E21,War in the Middle East.  so your mad that he's pulling troops out a country that did not attack us (9/11 hijackers weren't from Iraq) and sending more troops to the countries were al-qaeda (you know the one's that attacked us) are based?

2817,obama,Con,c-economy,B9,"The point is that under 3 years he has  created new spending, and he will continue to increase the debt with little mind to how this is a problem"
2818,obama,Con,c-republicans,B9,"  If you're looking for someone who will actually cut spending and the debt, look to Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate.  Otherwise, Romney is a slightly less big government hungry version of Obama."
2819,obama,Con,c-economy,B13," Even if you want to use the expense of welfare argument, that is not NEARLY the amount that went up in spending under the Obama administration. Unless Corporate welfare counts...  As well, Military spending and increased subsidies for various businesses. And continued Bank support, provisions for various organizations. More importantly, the unnecessary welfare spending that continues to rise but provide no benefit but only to create government dependence."
2820,obama,Con,c-republicans,B13,Ron Paul and other Libertarian thinkers believe that individuals benefit the most when they have choice over what to do with their own property.
2821,obama,Con,c-decision_policies,B13,"I agree that some welfare may still be necessary for those who need it most, but at the rate it is now (and how both Obama and Romney want to continue it) is not going to help increase the standard of living."
2822,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B8,I only support him now as the best of a bad lot
2823,obama,Pro,p-economy,B12,"He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include ""other extensions of relief that were also set to expire."" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that ""there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,"" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. ""That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,"" he said. ""And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people."""
2824,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,N11,"finishing more than 99.5% of the border fence  Adding more than 3,000 Border Patrol agents  Sending 1,200 national guard to border  increasing money, agents, investigators, prosecutors, surveillence, technology, etc."
2825,obama,Con,c-foreign_policies,N10,why has he not done anything about the Illegal aliens problem ? Other than it sure appears he will be allowing Criminal to have citizenship.
2826,obama,Con,c-War,N10,"he did not kill Ben laden either, navy Seals did..if that is even true , would not surprise me if it was all fabricated to create Stardom for Obama"
2827,obama,Pro,p-War,F1,He ended the war in Iraq
2828,obama,Pro,p-republicans,F1,"he is fixing problems with immigration, taxes, and the economy."
2829,obama,Pro,p-republicans,M36,Ron Paul is racist and against gay people. He would never have a chance at presidency.
2830,obama,Pro,p-health,M37,"Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar.  This bill will  decrease  the national debt by half a trillion over ten years. It's  good  for the economy.  You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick. This bill insures the uninsured, meaning that hospital visit will no longer be taken care of by tax payers. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. Which again saves money.  Then there is the whole human life thing. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare."
2831,obama,Pro,p-decision_policies,A35,I hope that the anti-obamas do realize that if he fought against abortion then he would have had to make some place for those babies to go if the parents didn't want the child.
2832,obama,Pro,p-economy,O2,"The Auto-industry was on the verge of collapse, when he came into office and now it's going strong. GM specifically was 17 months away from bankruptcy and now it's stocks are soaring and it has already paid back $11.8 billion to tax payers, 5 years ahead of schedule. Of the bank bailouts 66% of it has been paid back already. These averted bankruptcy and saved millions of jobs."
2833,obama,Pro,p-foreign_policies,O2,"Now add to that the fact that under His presidency Osama was killed, Gadaffi was killed, Egyptian President Mubarak was overthrown, and the Iraq war was ended."
2834,obama,Con,c-quality,J96,Obama won't win because he's a horrible president and people will regret voting for him and they will vote against him.
2835,obama,Con,c-quality,H14,"He sat in a church listening to a racist lunatic for 25 years and rather than leaving, wrote a book in which he referred to said racist lunatic as his mentor.  Then again, he did win a Nobel peace prize for no reason."
2836,obama,Pro,p-economy,G79,"Signed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act which gives the federal government more tools to investigate and prosecute fraud, from lending to the financial system, and creates a bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to investigate the financial practices that got us here"
2837,obama,Pro,p-job,A43,"When Obama took office we were losing on average 700,000 jobs per month. Now we've leveled off gaining some and losing some month to month."
2838,obama,Pro,p-health,A43,"And every president since Nixon except Bush Jr has wanted to pass a healthcare bill. Every single one. Obama has been the only President able to, and that in itself is going to put him on par with some great presidents."
2839,obama,Con,c-economy,A42,The Economy sucks still.

2843,obama,Pro,p-quality,B64,"While I wish he would have accomplished more, and not strayed as far from many of his campaign promises, Obama has done a decent job of trying to overcome the adversity of a republican controlled house/senate. If the evangelical right would learn to play nice there would be many more advances made in the effort to have the U.S. progress vs. reverse its global course."
2844,obama,Pro,p-republicans,B64,Obama inherited many of the deficiencies leftover from the Bush/Cheney debacle.
2845,obama,Con,c-War,F38,  He has gotten troops out of countries   Bush got them out. What Obama did was sent them to different countries.
2846,obama,Pro,p-economy,K33,fincial reform- made the banks do their buincess right
2847,obama,Pro,p-health,K33,heathcare reform - he was the first president to ever tackle heathcare it provided acces to heathcare and will finally get rid of the waste in heathcare and get people uninsured insured
