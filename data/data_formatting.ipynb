      "5 to abort a child is killing the child.\n",
      "6 From the time of conception, a child is alive\n",
      "7 If its taking nourishment from its mother, it's not quite a human being yet.\n",
      "8 I simply think it's the lesser evil of two, especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions, they just stop safe abortions. This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother.\n",
      "9 This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselvesâ€¦is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE\n",
      "10  We should not abort a fetus simply for the purpose that it will cause or bring convenience to us.\n",
      "11 every action has a consequence, and to say that just because you don't want to face that consequence does not mean you don't have to.\n",
      "12 First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.\n",
      "13 Brain waves have been recorded by EEG (electro- encephalograph) in the human embryo 40 days after fertilisation\n",
      "14 I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.\n",
      "15 There are more unwanted children than families willing to adopt\n",
      "16 babies that are adopted are given to families who want to raise them, not to just put up with them for a few months so they wouldnt be \"shuffled around in foster care\" they would be in permanent homes\n",

      "18 Its not a child , its a fetus. It has no feelings at all!\n",
      "19 Personally i think that people should have the ability to make there own choice.\n",
      "20 its better to abort an unwanted child than have it born into poverty and have it suffer immensely with hunger, etc. Also if an unwanted child is born because abortion wasnt an option. That child grows up without love, care, etc and again brings them into a cruel and punishing world with no love or support system also putting them at risk of depression later in life.  It may seem cruel or unfair to abort a child but honestly its far more cruel and unfair to bring a child into a world of poverty, hostility, hatred and other situations and emotions that often surround having an unwanted child.\n",
      "21 I am for a woman's right to chose.\n",
      "22 A fetus is also just cells. It is also not human yet.\n",

      "25 Abortion is wrong because it takes a life.\n",
      "26 The child in the raped woman's bodyâ€¦how is he/she at fault. Why should they lose their life because an act of violence happened to another living human being.\n",
      "27 A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs.\n",
      "28 The fetus uses the mother's body as its host. It depends solely on her for survival; no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation. If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so\n",
      "29 And when done on humans it ends the life of a human in the early stages of development.\n",
      "30 Technically speaking, a fetus is not a human yet.\n",
      "31 Having an abortion is similar to wearing a condom.\n",
      "32 Won't killing the fetus have a potential emotional side-effect on the parent? They would go through life knowing that they killed their own child.\n",
      "33 sometimes a child being born causes great strain on the parents and could possibly lead to death.\n",
      "34 Therefore, I believe that it should be the person's choice.\n",
      "35 Just because the child is unwanted does not mean it is unloved furthermore there are far more suitable alternatives like adoption\n",
      "36 the fetus is a living being that is growing and was created by God what right do you have to destroy what he has made good.\n",

      "43 Even if a zygote or early term fetus was a person (which it isn't)...  And even if that person had all the rights that other people have (which it doesn't).\n",
      "44 There is always adoption as an option!\n",
      "45 A person shouldn't be allowed to kill a future child.\n",
      "46 They are willing enough to create the child and I believe that they need to own up to their own responsibilities. It was their choice to tango and they need to pay up for it.\n",
      "47 There are other ways the child can get taken care of.\n",
      "48 Their parents kill them before they have a chance at life.\n",

      "50  A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana.\n",
      "51  Both are unfeeling. Both are unaware of existence. Both are composed of cells. Both have metabolism. Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds)\n",
      "52   The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING.\n",
      "53 But tell meâ€¦.what would you call killing a living human being without its permission? The unborn can't speak for themselves.   It does not matter what the procedure isâ€¦it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.\n",
      "54 A one month old embryo is only alive in the strict biological sense, the same way a plant is alive.\n",
      "55  One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.\n",
      "56  Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused.\n",
      "57 Put the baby up for adoption.\n",
      "58 A fetus is alive, regardless of how developed it is.\n",
      "59 You can have them be adopted if you are not ready with the child.\n",
      "60 Abortion = murder.\n",
      "61 And if they are human they have all the right to live.\n",
      "62 permission for an abortion could then be based on psychiatric considerations such as prepartum depression, especially if there is responsible psychiatric opinion that a continued pregnancy raises the strong probability of suicide in a clinically depressed patient.\n",
      "63 I believe that abortion should be legal because the fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights.\n",
      "64 I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand--namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body.\n",
      "65 its not a person until the baby comes out\n",
      "66 it can kill you to give birth\n",
      "67 I believe greater education is the answer to prevent teen pregnancy and the fallacy that abortion is just another form of birth control.\n",
      "68 But I absolutely do not believe the government should ban abortion. That is completely out of their jurisdiction and authority.\n",
      "69 what happened to you should not have killed the baby.\n",
      "70 honestly the baby did not do anything to you.\n",
      "71 people have the right to decide.\n",
      "72 if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child?\n",
      "73 some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor. this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life.\n",
      "74  No brain = no life. We don't care about what might happen, we care about present reality.\n",
      "75 so what if it doesn't have a brain yet still is going to get one and still has a whole future in front of him/her.\n",
      "76 your heart is a mass of tissue so why dont you suck that out and chuck it in the bin\n",
