There are four domains.

1. abortion
2. gayRights
3. obama
4. marijuana

For each domain, there is a folder with the reason-annotated files.   

Inside each folder, we have the reason-annotated files[*]. In each file, the text of a debate post is at the top, followed by the reason labels. If a reason is found in the text, we list the reason class first, followed by one or more text spans (each in a separate line) that represent the reason. Any other reason and the corresponding text span(s) found in the text are mentioned next in the same manner.

There is another folder called 'labels'. There is one file for each domain inside this folder. In each file, we list one label in each line and its meaning in the following line. The 'for' and the 'against' reasons are separated by a blank line.

The 'folds' folder contains the five cross validation folds for each domain.

[*] Please check the 'stance' folder provided with this dataset to learn more about these files (e.g., stance, author, and thread structure).
